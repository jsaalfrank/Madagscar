I want to study the host metabolism, so I digest the berries with enzyme md5.

    bash runHashBerries.sh  
	cat results/03_berryhash/BerryHash.md5  
	26440e799eb1109aadb2e09fa737dab4  /home/user/Desktop/uc-rnaseq/02_berryreplace/local/replaced\_berries\_result.txt

Result:  
The berries are now digested. Since this is a final result, it was added to 00_files.md.
