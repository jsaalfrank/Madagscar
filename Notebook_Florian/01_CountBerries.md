## Count berries with a simple R script

I wanted to know the total number of berries, because a fruit salad needs at least 20 items to be considered a fruit salad according to Fruitlov and Bananas 2021 (PubFruitID). I typed the R-script sumBerries.R executed and saved the result to 01\_berrycounts/results/berrysum\_result.txt.  

    bash runsumBerries.sh  
	cat results/berrysum_result.txt  
	24  

Result:  
The total number of berries is 24 so our berries are sufficient for a small fruit salad.
