# Background information about the project

## Organism

Human Stool samples

## Objective

To characterize intestinal eukaryotic communities across an urbanization and industrialization gradient, using samples from Madagascar (rural, peri-urban, and urban) and Germany (urban), and to investigate their co-occurances with bacterial gut microbes. 

## Goals

* Comprehensice profiling of intesinal eukaryotes regarding diversity and composition and comparative analysis regarding the different locations using 18S V4V5 rDNA amplicon sequencing.
* Comparative andaysis of bacterial microbes using 16S V3V4 rDNA amplicon sequencing.
* Identification of patterns associated with urbanization and industralization in both eukaryotic and bacterial communities.
* Analysis of co-occurances between eukaryotic and bacterial taxa.
* _Contextualization of findings regarding global microbiome studies and public health relevance._
