## qPCR 

To quantify the seuqencing-results suggesting a higher abundance of yeast Saccharomyces in German samples, quantitative Polymere Chain Reaction (qPCR) was performed on 50 samples origin of the CGBV Cohort 
sampled in Germany (Kiel) and respective 50 samples from Mahajanga (Madagascar). 

### Sample Population
The mean age in the two sub-cohorts was 41,14 years in Kiel and 40,76 in Mahajanga. 
For both sub-cohort 52% female and 48% male samples were included. 

### qPCR Protocol
qPCR protocol, prevously established by Corinna Bang was performed on a LightCycler 480. 

### Analysis of LightCycler 480 results 
A standard curve was calculated using different dilutions of the S.cere strain XYZ. 
The resulting regression equation is: 

Cp=−4,362*log10​(conc)+25,581

Using the equation, the concentration for each sample was calculated using Microsoft Excel. The final table including the original Cp-Value can be found in this folder

The results have been vizualized in R Studio (Version 2024.09.1+394). 
The script can be found in the R Mark-down file within this folder.
