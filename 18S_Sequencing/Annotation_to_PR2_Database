##Here, I am going to annotate the seqtab.nochim to the PR2 database (version 5.0.0. downloaded 22.05.2024)
##Note: PR2 has different taxLevels than the dada2 default. When assigning taxonomy against PR2,  Domain (replacing Kingdom), Supergroup, Division, Subdivision, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species
use the following: assignTaxonomy(..., taxLevels = c("Domain","Supergroup","Division","Subdevision", "Class","Order","Family","Genus","Species"))

library(dada2); packageVersion("dada2")

##where the PR2 database is stored
path_PR2 <- "/work_beegfs/ikmb_repository/databases/PR2/pr2_version_5.0.0_SSU_dada2.fasta"


#assign taxonomy to the seqtab.nochim generated in the session before and think about the different texLevels 
taxa <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab.nochim, path_PR2, multithread=TRUE, taxLevels = c("Domain","Supergroup","Division","Subdevision", "Class","Order","Family","Genus","Species"))



#check the fist lines of the taxa_table so that in the end can work with it! 
taxa.print <- taxa # Removing sequence rownames for display only
rownames(taxa.print) <- NULL
head(taxa.print)


##continue with PHYLOSEQ
