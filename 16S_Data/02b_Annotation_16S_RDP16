# Annotation of DADA2 Output to RDOP16 Database
Here, I am going to annotate the seqtab.nochim, created in 02a_DADA2_186S.Rmd. 
Download the rdp_train_set_16.fa.gz database and store it, if possible on a cluster. 

Note: the taxonomic ranks are automatively annotated
Note: Alternatively try to annotate your DADA2 output to the Greengene2 database from 2024 (https://zenodo.org/records/14169078)
PR2 has different taxLevels than the DADA2 default. When assigning taxonomy against PR2,  Domain (replacing Kingdom), Supergroup, Division, Subdivision, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species, so use the following: assignTaxonomy(..., taxLevels = c("Domain","Supergroup","Division","Subdevision", "Class","Order","Family","Genus","Species"))

## Install Libraries 
```{r}
library(dada2)
```

## Assing taxonomy to RDP16 Database
Clarify, where you stored your RDP16 Database and read the seqtab.nochim-table to your environment
```{r}
path_RDP <- "/work_beegfs/sukmb626/16S_Madagascar_Deutschland/rdp_train_set_16.fa.gz" # Where is your database stored
seqtab.nochim <- readRDS("/home/sukmb626/seqtab.nochim_16S_all.rds") # where you stored your seqtab.nochim

#assign taxonomy to the seqtab.nochim generated in the session before  
taxa <- data.frame(assignTaxonomy(merged_seqtab, "/work_beegfs/sukmb626/16S_Madagascar_Deutschland/rdp_train_set_16.fa.gz", multithread=4))                                      

#check the fist lines of the taxa_table so that in the end can work with it! 
taxa.print <- taxa # Removing sequence rownames for display only
rownames(taxa.print) <- NULL
head(taxa.print)

##save the taxa table to continue with the generating of the Phyloseq Object
saveRDS(taxa,"/work_beegfs/sukmb626/16S_Madagascar_Deutschland/tax_assign_ASV_Bayes_16RDP.rds")
```
